Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

It can be verified that triangle ABC
 contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Using triangles.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.

Answer:  228
